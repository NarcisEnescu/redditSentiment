Line 19 is no longer functional due to an update Reddit made to their API. Read more here:

Changed line 24 	from 
	for submissions in sub_submissions: 
		to
	for submission in subreddit.hot(limit=100):
The algorithm no longer picks submissions from  a time interval (time_start, time_end) as intended. It picks the first 100 posts sorted by hot. 
 I have no idea how to make it work as originally intended : ^ )
